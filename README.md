## Workflow

- **Branching Strategy:**
  - Feature branches are used for each user story, named using the format `feature/UHxxxx-brief-description`.
  - Bug fixes are managed with branches named `fix/UHxxxx-brief-description`.
  - All changes must be merged into the main branch after peer reviews.

- **Pull Requests (PRs):**
  - Each developer must create a PR once their feature is complete, including a detailed description of changes. PRs require at least three approvals before merging.
  - The QA team will test each feature branch before it is merged to ensure it meets the acceptance criteria.

- **Commit Messages:**
  - Commit messages follow a consistent format: 
    - For features: `feat(UHxxxx): short description of the feature`
    - For fixes: `fix(UHxxxx): short description of the fix`
